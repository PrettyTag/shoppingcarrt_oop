## Project Description
This project, authored by Nyakate Agnes Tagaya, utilizes key Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to implement a shopping cart system for a shop.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Aspects Used:

1. **Classes and Objects:**
   - Multiple classes such as `Product`, `ShoppingCart`, `Customer`, and `Admin` are defined, each representing specific entities in the shopping cart system.

2. **Encapsulation:**
   - Classes encapsulate related attributes and behaviors, providing a clear structure and hiding internal details.

3. **Abstraction:**
   - Abstraction is achieved by defining classes with essential attributes and methods, allowing users to interact with high-level functionalities.

4. **Modularity:**
   - The project is organized into distinct classes, promoting modularity and making the code more maintainable.

5. **File Handling:**
   - File handling operations are implemented to read from and write to external files, supporting data persistence.

6. **Dependency Management:**
   - Classes are designed to depend on each other to achieve specific functionalities, promoting a modular and interconnected structure.
